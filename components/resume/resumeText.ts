I've always been a real IT geek. 
You know... the kind of kid who fixes all the computers in the neighborhood 
and tries to run games on his computer that require far more powerful hardware than his PC can handle.
I'm starving for anything and everything related to IT, 
so there was never any question about what I would do when I decided to start a new career after several years as a successful sponsored online poker player.
